# Sports Fan Loyalty Token (SLT)

## Overview
The Sports Fan Loyalty Token (SLT) is a blockchain-based fan engagement system built on the Stacks blockchain, leveraging Bitcoin's security. This project enables sports teams to create and manage tokenized loyalty programs where fans can earn, trade, and redeem tokens for various rewards including merchandise, tickets, and exclusive experiences.

## Features
- **SFT-20 Compatible Token**: Implements a standard-compliant fungible token
- **Reward Tiers System**: Multiple loyalty tiers with different benefits
- **Administrative Controls**: Secure management of token distribution and rewards
- **Transparent Tracking**: All transactions and reward distributions are recorded on-chain

## Technical Architecture
### Smart Contract Structure
The project consists of a main Clarity smart contract with the following components:

1. **Token Management**
   - Balance tracking
   - Transfer functionality
   - Minting capabilities (restricted to contract owner)

2. **Reward System**
   - Tiered rewards structure
   - Configurable reward levels
   - Automated reward distribution

### Data Maps
```clarity
(define-map balances principal uint)
(define-map reward-tiers uint {
    name: (string-ascii 32),
    required-tokens: uint,
    discount: uint
})
```

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Stacks blockchain development environment
- Clarity CLI tools
- A Stacks wallet for testing

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd sports-loyalty-token
```

2. Deploy the contract (using Clarinet)
```bash
clarinet contract deploy
```

## Usage
### For Team Administrators
```clarity
;; Mint new tokens
(contract-call? .sports-loyalty-token mint u1000 'SPGEN5ZXPPW3VQJE1Y31P3QSKX11XCBV8BTGZDKX)

;; Add a reward tier
(contract-call? .sports-loyalty-token add-reward-tier u1 "Silver" u1000 u10)
```

### For Fans
```clarity
;; Check balance
(contract-call? .sports-loyalty-token get-balance 'SPGEN5ZXPPW3VQJE1Y31P3QSKX11XCBV8BTGZDKX)

;; Transfer tokens
(contract-call? .sports-loyalty-token transfer u100 'SPGEN5ZXPPW3VQJE1Y31P3QSKX11XCBV8BTGZDKX 'SP2J6ZY48GV1EZ5V2V5RB9MP66SW86PYKKNRV9EJ7)
```

## Roadmap
### Phase 1 (Current)
- [x] Basic token implementation
- [x] Reward tiers system
- [x] Administrative functions

### Phase 2 (Planned)
- [ ] Merchandise and ticket redemption
- [ ] Time-locked exclusive experiences
- [ ] Enhanced reward mechanics

### Phase 3 (Future)
- [ ] Interactive elements (games, predictions)
- [ ] Cross-team compatibility
- [ ] Advanced analytics dashboard

## Security
- Contract owner privileges are restricted to authorized team administrators
- All functions include proper access controls
- Balance checks prevent unauthorized token creation

## Testing
Run the test suite using Clarinet:
```bash
clarinet test
```
